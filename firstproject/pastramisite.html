    <figcaption>Time to make some pastrami for your friends who are pretentious.</figcaption>
    <p>Albeit this is a simple but at the same time elaborate little project to cook, it is worth it!</p>
    <p><strong>Main Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 quarts water</li>
        <li>3/4 cup Morton's coarse kosher salt (178 grams) OR 1 1/3 cup Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt (181 grams) - these two brands are NOT interchangeable, the same weight provides two very different cup measurements</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pink curing salt (12 grams) - Pink curing salt is also known as Prague Mix #1, Instacure #1 or Curing Salt #1 - NOT Himalayan pink salt. See safety note below.</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pickling spice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon whole coriander seeds</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon whole yellow mustard seeds</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>5 pounds of brisket</li>
    </ul>
        <strong>Spice Rub Ingredients</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup ground coriander</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons smoked paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the brine, fill a medium to large stockpot with 3 quarts water. Add the kosher and pink salts, granulated sugar, pickling spice, coriander and mustard seeds, and garlic. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring often to fully dissolve the salt and sugar in the water. Immediately remove the pot from the heat once the brine boils.
            Add 3 quarts ice cold water to a 2-gallon or larger food-safe container that will fit in your refrigerator (you can also use a strong sealing 2-gallon marination bag - double bag for extra insurance). Pour the brine into the container and place it uncovered in the refrigerator until completely cool. You can also divide the brine evenly between two separate containers so that it will fit better in the refrigerator.
        </li>
        <li>
            Trim the fat from the brisket until the fat layer is about 1/4 inch thick. 
        </li>
        <li>
            If necessary, cut the brisket in half so that it will fit into your container(s).
        </li>
        <li>
            Submerge the brisket in the cooled brine.
            Allow the brisket to brine in the refrigerator for 10 to 12 days, flipping it daily top to bottom and stirring the brine. Make sure that if any of the brisket sides are touching one another you regularly turn them away from each other to expose all of the sides to the brine.
        </li>
        <li>
            To cook the brisket, pour 4 cups water into the bottom of a 12 by 15 inch roasting pan. Set a rack inside the pan and place the brisket on the rack, fatty side down.
        </li>
        <li>
            To make the spice rub, mix together the coriander, pepper and paprika in a small bowl. Evenly rub 1/4 cup of the mixture onto the top of the brisket. Then flip the brisket and rub the remaining spice mixture onto the fatty side. Allow the brisket to come to room temperature, about 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 300 degrees with a rack low enough to fit the pan holding the brisket. Tightly cover the brisket and pan with a double layer of aluminum foil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 200 degrees, about 1 hour per pound or 5 hours total. Start checking internal temp at 3 hours and periodically every 20-30 minutes or so to avoid overcooking.
        </li>
        <li>
            Without trimming the fat, carve the pastrami into 1/4 inch thick slices, or cut as thin as possible without the meat falling apart. Keep tightly wrapped, or in a sealed container in the fridge, for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 6 months.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>SAFETY NOTE:</strong> handle the pink curing salt with care and keep it out of reach of children. It is used in pastrami and other cured meats to kill bacteria, prevent botulism and add flavor. However it is extremely toxic if ingested directly; in fact, it's colored pink to prevent people from mistaking it for regular salt. When used with care in recipes like this, it is very safe and necessary for proper flavor and food safety. That said, you should know the risks and keep the curing salt properly labeled and out of the reach of children.
