    <p><strong>Jajang sauce</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir-fry the pork belly in a large, deep wok (or pan) with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil for about 4-5 minutes, until golden brown and crispy.
        </li>
        <li>Pour out the excess pork fat.
        </li>
        <li>Add radish and stir fry for 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>Add potato, onion, and zucchini and keep stirring for about 3 minutes until the potato looks a little translucent.
        </li>
        <li>Clear a space in the center of the wok by pushing the ingredients to the edges</li>
        <li>Add 2 Tablespoons of vegetable oil to the center of the wok, then add ¼ cup of black bean paste and stir it with a wooden spoon for 1 minute to fry it. Then mix everything in the wok and keep stirring.</li>
        <li>Add  2 cups of water to the wok and let it simmer and cook with the lid closed for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Open the lid and taste a sample of the radish and potato. If they’re fully cooked, stir in the starch water little by little. Keep stirring until it’s well mixed and thick.
        </li>
        <li>Add the sesame oil and remove from the heat.
        </li>
