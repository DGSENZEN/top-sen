    <h2>It's Lasagna Time!</h2>
    <figcaption>I hope you are ready to do some great lasagna!</figcaption>
    <p>Here are some of the pretty important ingredients you will need:</p>
    <h3> Ingredient List: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat: 1 pound sweet Italian sausage, ¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>Onions and Garlic:  ½ cup minced onion, 2 cloves garlic, crushed.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Tomato: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste. </li>
        <li>Cheeses: 1 pound thinly sliced mozzarella cheese about 24 slices! 1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Lasagna Noodles: Use store-bought, or home-made!</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
        <li>Spices: 2 tablespoons white sugar, 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil, 1 teaspoon fennel seeds, 1 teaspoon ground oregano,
    </ul>
    <p>
        Now that we have our ingredient list we can proceed to our process of cooking:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot over medium heat, add in ground sausage and ground beef. Use a spoon to break up the meat into small pieces. Add in onion and garlic and cook until meat is well browned, stirring constantly. Stir in sugar, fresh basil, fennel, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup chopped parsley. Pour in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and wine*. Stir well and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer 1-4 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles into the bottom of a pan. Pour hot tap water directly over the noodles, making sure the pasta is completely immersed in the water. Let them soak for 30 minutes, then drain and discard water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg. Refrigerate until ready to assemble lasagna.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a deep 9x13 pan.</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread about 1 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of the prepared pan. Place 4 noodles on top. Spread with 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/4 of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, then sprinkle with 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. Repeat layering two more times to create three complete layers. To finish, place a final layer of pasta, topped with another 1 cup of meat sauce to cover the pasta. Top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover loosely with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes to allow cheese to brown. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And that is it!  You have a lasagna!</p>
